Reart is a project focused on Web3. The idea was to create a Demo Platform where users could buy NFTs and for that I would need to study new technologies (and I love learning new things). Up until the point of this project, Solidity was a new language for me and I'm still studying it. I know there are many resources to be explored yet, but I used what I know in this project.

This project uses only a Smart Contract to make the transactions and each user (and user resource) is identified by the information collected from the transactions by the blockchain. Remember, it's a Demo application.

**Stack/Resources:** TypeScript, Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, Ethers.js, React, MetaMask, Cloud Firestore (used for views and collections control), Firebase Hosting

## How To Use

You must install <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">**MetaMask**</a> and create a wallet. It is also necessary that you use the **Goerli Test Network** (this platform only works with this network):

Then, get some testnet Ether (ETH) through the <a href="https://goerlifaucet.com/" target="_blank">**Goerli Faucet**</a> website. At this point you are ready to use the platform.
